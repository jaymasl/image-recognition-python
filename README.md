This script utilizes LLaVA (Large Language and Vision Assistant) to identify images based on keyword descriptors, iterating 30 times by default. It generates two outputs: a list of primary keywords and a corresponding list indicating the frequency of each keyword's identification. The `aggregate_keywords()` function further enhances this process by consolidating similar terms to minimize redundancy. Increasing the number of iterations can yield a more refined set of accurate visual descriptors by providing additional opportunities for identification.
